So, when you propose a hot beverage to your guests, the &quot;Sure! What you got?&quot; answer can become problematic. This utility aims at solving this problem. Store all your beverages in a Google Drive sheet and show the list to your guests. They can use filters (or even full-text search) to show only the beverages they are interested in, and if there's is still too much choice, let chance decide. When they're done, you only have to check the pick summary to know how many cups you must prepare in each temperature and how long to brew each. The list is designed to be responsive and work on mobile devices, so that you can pick your tablet, bring the menu up and pass it among your guests. But... &quot;beverages&quot;?True, the name is a bit broad, as this was more specifically designed for hot beverages, especially teas. It should however not require that much work to adapt it to work fine with beers or even wines, replacing the basis with the wine color or beer type, the brand with the brewery, time with the type of dish this goes with… You are welcome to fork and make it your own. Use itJet startEasy enough: Prepare your Google Sheet: Go to the template and log into your Google account (don't have one? Sorry, I can't help you there).

Save to your own Google Drive. Fill it out with your data. Make your data available to the plugin: Publish your Google Sheet (File &amp;rightarrow Publish to the web...; Publish). Copy the ID of your sheet in the URL (e.g. 15DoM_Y1uH9zQWAgPxpiSegYGlP7gnoelFpxv4d91zJI in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15DoM_Y1uH9zQWAgPxpiSegYGlP7gnoelFpxv4d91zJI/edit#gid=0). Prepare your page to run the script: Include the plugin stylesheet (or write your own):&lt;link href=&quot;dist/beverages.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt; Include the plugin JavaScript (in the language you prefer; English and French available):&lt;script src=&quot;dist/beverages.fr.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; Call it up and pass the ID from you Google Sheet:beverages('15DoM_Y1uH9zQWAgPxpiSegYGlP7gnoelFpxv4d91zJI'); OptionsYou can pass options to the plugin if need be: beverages({ gSheetId: '15DoM_Y1uH9zQWAgPxpiSegYGlP7gnoelFpxv4d91zJI', filters: { basis: ['teas'], autoTime: true, times: ['unknown'] } }); Option Mandatory Format Description gSheetId Yes String The ID of the Google Sheet containing your data.

CompatibilityThis plugin was written to be compatible with: the latest two versions of each major browsers; Internet Explorer from version 9; the latest ESR version of Firefox.

The corresponding source pages are dev/index.html and dev/offline.html. Customizing the stylesheetThe easiest way is to create your own style is to clone the project. You may be able to get the appearance you wish for simply by updating the _variables.scss file. If not, update the style as you wish. Known issuesIssue #22: This plugin is built upon Bootstrap v4-alpha. The styles imported from it leak outside of the target container and may wreak havoc your own styling. To sum up: this plugin is best used on its own or with your own custom stylesheet. This is to be fixed however as we work to design our own style, totally independent from Bootstrap. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.4 on 2018-01-23T08:03:39+00:00 using the DocStrap template.
