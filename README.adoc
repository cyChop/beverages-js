= beverages.js

When people often give you teas as presents, they tend to add up. So, when you propose a hot beverage to your guests and they ask "what you got?", well, it may get complicated.

I thought an interactive and (relatively) easy to maintain list would be a nice project.

If all goes my way, once it's done, you'll just have to fork it and make your own database to have your own tea menu.
